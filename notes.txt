//make the state controllers work in their own files- look at old project
//make sure that file is never getting touched. If so, get rid of it.



-add an app-wide controller
-should all of these controllers, etc. be in main.js or files with the pages?
-fix pageOne code (the player stuff)
-copy everything over bit by bit- checking for things that are hard-coded

-make a new favicon and then uncomment server/app.js line 21











add processing stuff :-)
see if I should use socket.io for anything cause it's easy to add
