The next room has a number of interesting statues. Men, women, and children are depicted doing everything from sitting at a computer to fighting a lion. Seeing all of these stone people pushes a thought to the forefront of your mind. A thought that's been bothering you since you arrived: "where are all the other people? Why am I the only one here?" Followed quickly, of course, by the ever-present thought of, "Why am I here?"
You almost expect one of these statues to come alive at any moment. Or for something to turn you to stone. You're actually getting really creeped being in this room and quickly hurry on.
Through an arched doorway, you enter a courtyard. There are 4 other arched doorways you can choose to walk through. In the middle of the courtyard is a very strange fountain.

The callback from set interval iterates through an array of messages and pops up a new alert every minute. alert(arrayOfMessages[i]) 3. It also starts a setTimer. After 4 minutes, set timer state.go("timerEnd) What started as a light breeze has become a gale-force hurricane. You desperately try to find something to hide inside, but you are picked up by the ferocious winds. You are thrown roughly against a wall and then pushed out the nearest arched doorway, clawing and scratching at the ground and walls, you try to gain purchase anywhere. This living nightmare soon ends as you are blown through one last, intricately decorated, archway, and fall thousands of feet to your death on the rocky crag below. You scream as you fall. You also have enough time to both be filled with terror at your impending death, and, paradoxically, enjoy the sensation of falling, like a thrill ride at an amusement park.
The end.
