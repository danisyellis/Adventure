<h4>
The next room contains a furnace filled with glowing rocks. The rocks give the room a nice warm glow. You feel happy here. Contented. More comfortable than you've felt since this strange adventure began.
	If you decide to stay in this room a little longer and get your wits about you, press here
	<!-- (ng-show)  -->You are relieved to realize that you can pause a moment somewhere that you feel safe. Your racing mind begins to slow and you try to come up with a plan to get out of this place. But, the longer you're in this comfortingly glowing room, the less you want to leave it. Happily, though with a tinge of guilt, you stretch out on the floor and lie down, intending to meditate briefly. But, as you let thoughts pass through your mind, meditating soon turns into napping. And this nap becomes a contented eternal sleep.
