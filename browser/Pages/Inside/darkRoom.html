<h3>The next room is very dark
	<!-- (if have flashlight, ng-show:) You turn on your flashlight, grateful that you grabbed it, and look around. In the corner of the room, lying sideways on the ground, is a mostly-full bottle of cloudy white liquid. You pick up the bottle and examine it. The bottle has a bulbous bottom and a narrow neck. You guess that maybe this means the liquid should be used sparingly and might be quite potent. For now, you decide to pocket the bottle and move along.

There's a door on the other side of the room. <a ui-sref="glowingRocks">You hurry through it. </a>
