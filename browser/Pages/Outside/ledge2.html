	<h3>
	You find yourself on a ledge, looking out at a vast land. Rolling grassy hills, small forests, and inviting lakes as far as the eye can see. You desperately want to get down off this ledge and explore.

	<h4>What the hell, you think. You pull out the stick and try to do some magic with it. "Leviosa wingardium!" you shout. But this isn't Harry Potter, so nothing happens. Ah well, at least you tried. You throw the stick off the ledge, no reason to carry around a useless stick. To your amazement, the stick doesn't drop, instead it hovers in the air 4 feet away, where you threw it. You walk to the very edge of this ledge you're standing on and can just barely grab the stick with the very tips of your outstretched fingers. But the moment you touch it, something magical happens, and you realize with a start that magic must be real after all. Because now you're levitating along with the stick! </h4>

	<h4>You try a few different positions and maneuvers, and ultimately decide to fly through the air like Superman- belly down, arms and legs outstretched, facing adventure. You spend the rest of your life adventuring in this new land. For the first few days, you delight in reaching the tops of the tallest peaks, doing barrel rolls and dives in the air, skinny dipping in remote alpine lakes, foraging for exciting new foods, and roaming across the sky following whatever birds you come across. Eventually though, you get lonely and start flying closer to sea level, looking for people. Happily, you find some. The first few times, you aren't very careful. Groups of humans see you flying toward them and spook. Warriors brandish weapons, a few even shoot at you. Others simply turn and run. You don't give chase. Instead, you fly on. Now that you know there are people around, you can be choosy- approach people more carefully, don't frighten them, don't let them know you can fly. Eventually, you come upon a group of people that just gets you. And you get them. It's a small community, but it has everything you need. You still fly away on adventures of course. Often. But you always come back home.

	if(no stick) You see a set of dilapidated, crumbling stairs leading to the bottom. They don't look particularly safe, but you decide to chance it. Carefully, you make your way down the stairs. It's an exhausting descent, and hard on your knees, but finally, you make it to the bottom. At this point, your stomach is rumbling and you really just want to take a nap, but you press on. It is gorgeous here. You strike out in a random direction. You see amazing flowers and animals you've never seen before. This is invigorating, but you're worried about finding food and shelter before dark. 
	Finally, you come upon this amazing building:

	Cautiously, you approach it, and knock. No answer. You open the door. It is filled with camping supplies, including food rations! You think about spending the night here, but don't want to run into the owners in the middle of the night. So you grab a backpack, a tent, some warm clothes, and enough food to last for a week, and set off again, not knowing what awaits you...
